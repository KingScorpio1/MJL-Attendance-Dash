Version 2
Enhanced CRM Features:
Add a "Parent Contact Info" field to each student.
Create a "Communications Log" for each student where teachers can note down "Spoke to John's mother on 10/25 about his progress."
Enhanced TMS Features:
Resource Management: Add the concept of "Rooms" or "Venues" and assign them to classes.
Billing/Invoicing: Track payments for classes (this is a very advanced feature).
Adding LMS Features (A Big Step):
You could add a "Materials" section to each class, where a teacher could upload a PDF or link to a video. This would be your first step toward becoming an LMS.

Version 3
Feature 1: The Parent/Student Portal (The Game-Changer)
Description: Create a new, separate login area for parents or students. When they log in, they would see a dashboard tailored specifically to them.
User Story (Parent): "As a parent, I want to log in and see my child's attendance record for the past month, view their upcoming class schedule on the calendar, and access any materials the teacher has uploaded for their class."
Key Features:
View Attendance History: A read-only view of their child's attendance.
View Class Schedule: A filtered version of the calendar showing only their classes.
Access Class Materials: A read-only view of the "Materials" tab for their enrolled classes.
Communication: A simple way to view communication logs or even send a message to the teacher.
Value: This adds immense value for the school's customers, improving communication and engagement. This is a major selling point.

Feature 2: Advanced Payroll & Reporting
Description: Build on your payroll system to make the accountant's job even easier.
Feature Ideas:
Printable Payslips: Generate a clean, printable PDF payslip for each teacher for a given month.
Expense Tracking: Allow teachers to submit expenses (e.g., for materials they bought) and allow accountants to approve them and add them to the payroll run.
Custom Report Builder: An advanced feature where an admin could build their own reports (e.g., "Show me the attendance rate for all trial students in May").

Feature 3: Mobile-First Experience / Progressive Web App (PWA)
Description: While your site is responsive, the next step is to optimize it for a mobile-first experience and enable it to be "installed" on a user's home screen like a native app.
Why it's great: A teacher could quickly take attendance on a tablet in the classroom. A parent could check their child's schedule from their phone as if it were a dedicated app.
How to do it: This involves more advanced service worker configurations (some of which are already included with create-react-app's workbox integration) and ensuring every page is perfectly usable on a small screen.

Feature 4: The "Super Admin" Dashboard
Description: For a school owner or director, create a "Super Admin" dashboard that consolidates the most important business metrics into one view.
Feature Ideas:
Revenue Projections: Based on class costs and student enrollment.
Teacher Performance: Metrics on which teachers have the best attendance rates in their classes.
Student Retention: Reports on how many students continue from one month to the next.
